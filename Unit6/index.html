            In this article, I hope to detail the various reasons I believe we need to have the Tomatina festival everywhere.
            I hope that everyday people, government officials in both local and federal positions, and people in positions of authority will come together to agree on a common course of action for the betterment of humanity.
            The main problem in society today is a lack of connection between people.
            I believe this problem can be solved by globally implementing the La Tomatina festival.
            La Tomatina is a one hour period in Spain where people throw tomatoes at each other.
            I believe that La Tomatina has the power to heal the world and unite people of different ideologies together.

            La Tomatina is a festival in Spain where people throw tomatoes at each other.
            La Tomatina stems from a parade in 1945 which turned into a good fight with tomatoes.
            The following years, the scenario was repeated until it was officially organized by the city council.
            La Tomatina is celebrated on the last wednesday of August.

        <h1>Why we need La Tomatina</h1>
        <p>
            Societies are bound to go through tumultuous times, but it is precisely in times like these that we need strength and unity.
            I believe that La Tomatina can bring us the strength and unity we need to persevere.
            In times like these where polarization effects large swaths of people, and despite the existence of the internet we are more disconnected than ever, we need La Tomatina.
